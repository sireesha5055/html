        <p>
            India has participated in every edition of the tournament since 1975. India first won the 1983 Cricket World Cup, under the captaincy of Kapil Dev. India become the second team after the West Indies (when they won in 1975 and 1979) to win the Cricket World Cup. India's next win came at the 2011 Cricket World Cup, under the captaincy of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, 28 years after the previous win. With this win, India became the first nation to win the tournament on home soil as India was hosting the tournament final itself, and the second co-host to win the tournament after Sri Lanka (when they won in 1996). India became the third team after Australia (when they won in 1987, 1999, 2003 and 2007) and West Indies to win two world cups.
